# GitHub Style Generator

This tool generates the GitHub style with official GitHub style package. npm 5 or above is required (to make use of `package-lock.json`). To update the style, rename the Sass file to something meaningful, and run:

```bash
npm install
npm update primer-markdown
npm run build
```
